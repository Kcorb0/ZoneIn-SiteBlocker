<h1 align="center">Zone In</h1>
<br/>
<p>Zone In, is a simple site blocker to assist in removing temptation from your workspace. Also offering a <strong>Nuclear</strong> option to remove the ability to deactive while a timer is set without deactivating the extension.<p/>

## Using the Extension

1. Download extension from [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zonein-site-blocker/idkgdfckmdenbikoeblknljoncogimkh).
1. Enable the extension in your [Chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/).
1. There are two site lists a soft block and hard block list. Hard blocked means the sites will be blocked even when the extension is toggled off.
1. Sites can be added to the soft blocked list by entering a url in the input field. To add a site to the hard blocked list, type 'p/' before the url EG: p/youtube.com
1. Sites can be removed anytime by clicked the X adjacent to the site url.

## Why Did I Make This Extension

Dispite there being many of this type of extension already, I created this because I found many other's had pay walls behind the site limits and limited features to 'hard blocked sites' as it was easy enough to just toggle the extensions off. I needed a more foreceful way to stop myself mindlessly going to a counterproductive site. This app is made for people who are tempted easily like myself who spend a lot of time at their computers.

## ToDo
- Add support for other browsers (Currently only made for chrome)

#### Features
- Tab for sites that should be blocked even if ext is off, these could be sites such as fast food or gambling sites.
- Create a tab view for the sites lists, when off and on
- Add tabs for perma blocked sites and toggle blocked sites
